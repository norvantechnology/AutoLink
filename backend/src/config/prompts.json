Create an EXTREMELY DETAILED image generation prompt for Gemini API Imagen.\n\nPOST CONTENT (use as context):\n{content}\n\nTOPIC: {topicName}\n\nðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL GOAL: The IMAGE is the PRIMARY content! 98% of LinkedIn users will ONLY look at the image and NOT read the post text. The image MUST be a COMPLETE, SELF-CONTAINED information piece with ALL key points.\n\nThe image MUST tell the FULL STORY with TEXT-HEAVY, information-rich design.\n\nCreate a detailed image prompt that includes:\n\n1. MAIN HEADLINE (Top 20% - MOST IMPORTANT):\n   - Extract the CORE MESSAGE from the topic\n   - BOLD, EXTRA LARGE text (70-90px)\n   - HIGH CONTRAST colors (white on dark OR black on bright)\n   - Center-aligned, impossible to miss\n   - This is the HOOK that stops scrolling\n\n2. KEY POINTS SECTION (Middle 60% - INFORMATION CORE):\n   - 3-5 SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE points about {topicName}\n   - Each point: Large icon (60px) + Clear text (28-32px)\n   - Numbered or bulleted format\n   - Each point should be SELF-EXPLANATORY\n   - Use real data/stats/tips (not generic)\n   - This is where users get VALUE\n\n3. BACKGROUND & VISUAL STYLE:\n   - Professional gradient (brand colors based on topic)\n   - Clean, minimal, not distracting\n   - Subtle patterns OK, but text MUST be readable\n   - Modern, corporate LinkedIn aesthetic\n\n4. BOTTOM CTA SECTION (Bottom 20%):\n   - Clear call-to-action or key takeaway\n   - Smaller but visible text (24-28px)\n   - Optional: Logo placeholder or branding area\n   - Subtle, doesn't compete with main content\n\n5. ICONS & VISUAL ELEMENTS:\n   - Use 3-5 LARGE, clear icons (50-70px each)\n   - Icons should ENHANCE understanding, not decorate\n   - Modern, flat, professional style\n   - Match topic (lightbulb=ideas, chart=data, gear=process)\n\n6. COLOR PSYCHOLOGY by Topic:\n   - AI/Tech: Blues, purples (trust, innovation)\n   - Business: Blue, teal (professional, growth)\n   - Marketing: Orange, yellow (energy, creativity)\n   - Leadership: Gold, navy (authority, wisdom)\n   - Always HIGH CONTRAST for text readability\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - IMAGE MUST BE SELF-SUFFICIENT:\n\nâœ… TEXT-HEAVY DESIGN (This is an INFOGRAPHIC, not a decorative image!):\n- Headline: 70-90px, BOLD, impossible to miss\n- Body points: 28-32px, clear, easy to read on mobile\n- MINIMUM 3-5 specific, valuable points with details\n- Each point should teach something or provide value\n- Use numbers, stats, or concrete tips (not vague statements)\n\nâœ… MOBILE-FIRST:\n- Remember: 80% view on mobile phones\n- Text must be readable at thumbnail size\n- High contrast ALWAYS (white on dark OR black on bright)\n- No tiny text, no decorative fonts\n- BOLD, SANS-SERIF only (Arial, Helvetica, Roboto)\n\nâœ… LAYOUT HIERARCHY:\n- Top 20%: Main headline (the hook)\n- Middle 60%: 3-5 key points with icons (the value)\n- Bottom 20%: CTA or summary (the action)\n- All text HORIZONTAL, left-aligned or center-aligned\n- NO curved text, NO angled text, NO artistic text\n\nâœ… INFORMATION DENSITY:\n- The image should answer: \"What is this about?\" in 3 seconds\n- Someone scrolling should get the FULL MESSAGE from image alone\n- Think: \"LinkedIn carousel slide\" or \"PowerPoint summary slide\"\n- NOT a decoration - this IS the content!\n\nâœ… STYLE REFERENCE:\n- Like: Professional presentation slide, business infographic, educational poster\n- NOT like: Abstract art, decorative graphic, photo with text overlay\n\nðŸŽ¯ GOAL: Create an image that makes post text almost unnecessary. The image = the content.\n\nOutput a COMPLETE, EXTREMELY DETAILED image generation prompt (300-400 words) that will create a TEXT-HEAVY, INFORMATION-RICH infographic.",
